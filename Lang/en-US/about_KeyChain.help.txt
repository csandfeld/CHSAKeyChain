SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the functionality of the KeyChain module.


LONG DESCRIPTION
    KeyChain is a simple module you can use to store credentials for later use.
    The module simply assign a key (a tag or label if you will) to a credential
    object, and store the object in an XML file, made with the Export-CliXml.
    
    If no KeyChain file is specified, it will store the credentials in:

        $env:USERPROFILE\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\KeyChain.xml

    You can point to a custom KeyChain file with the KeyChain parameter.

    Credentials are stored by exporting PSCredential objects to XML with the
    Export-CliXml Cmdlet.
    
    The PSCredential object use the Data Protection Application Programming 
    Interface (DPAPI) to encrypt the password, alowing only the user account
    that entered the password to decrypt it. The encryption key is stored in 
    the user profile. Thus credentials exported to an XML file are safe from
    prying eyes.

    
  USAGE EXAMPLE
    Say you have a number of different credentials you use on a regular basis,
    for PowerShell related work. Rather than having to enter those credentials
    every time you need them, you can store them in a KeyChain file, and get 
    them whenever you need them.


    If you have a credential object stored in a variable and want to add it to
    your KeyChain:

        $Cred = Get-Credential User1

        Add-KeyChainKey -Key TEST1 -Credential $Cred

    Or if you just want to add credential to the KeyChain without storing in a
    variable first just specify a UserName and it will prompt for password:

        Add-KeyChainKey -Key TEST2 -UserName User2

    The above methods are also used to update (overwrite) a key

    
    Now to get all credentials stored in your KeyChain simply run:

        Get-KeyChainKey

    Or to get a specific key labeled TEST1 run:

        Get-KeyChainKey -Key TEST1

    To read your stored keys into a variable and use a key labeled TEST1 as
    credential for Get-WmiObject:

        $Keys = Get-KeyChainKey
        
        Get-WmiObject -Credential $Keys.TEST1 -ComputerName SERVER -Class Win32_Service


    To remove a key labeled TEST1 from your KeyChain file:

        Remove-KeyChainKey -Key TEST1


    To use an alternative KeyChain file, all functions support the KeyChain
    parameter:

        Get-KeyChainKey -KeyChain C:\My\Custom\KeyChain\File.xml
